				<p>Castles of Dr. Creep is a 1984 Commodore 64 game written by Ed Hobbs and published by Broderbund Software.</p>
				<p>This project is an open source rewrite, allowing you to play the game using an image (D64) of the original disk.<br/>
			  Additionally, a Castle Builder has been added allowing the player to modify existing castles, or build new ones from scratch</p>
				<p>Presently it can compile and play on both Windows, Nintendo Wii, FreeBSD, MacOS X, and Linux (Ubuntu specifically has been tested).</p>
